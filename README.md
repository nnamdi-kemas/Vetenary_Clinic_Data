# Vetenary_Clinic_Data

## Overview

I was required to assist a vertinary clinic make sense of their data. Their data is dispersed accross multiple CSV files and they needed me to perform the following analytics

1. Extract information on pet names and owners' names sids by side.
2. Find out which pets from this clinic had precedures performed.
3. Match up all procedures performed to the descriptions.
4. Extract a table of individual costs (procedure prices) incurred by owners of pets from the clinic in question (the table should have owner and procedure price side by side).
